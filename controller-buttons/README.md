These buttons have been created by Jannik Vogel (JayFoxRox).


The SVG files are created using [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).


The blend file is to be used with [blender](https://www.blender.org/). Additionally, you need [luxrender](http://www.luxrender.net/).
You'll also need an HDR for lighting (or create your own lights).
I recommend [HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com/).
